# Thank you so much for coming to the S777C Winter Skinning Contest!!!

2. To make it easier to designate parts, I have created a "map" of sorts to show you what piece is where on the vehicle. View each vehicle in [this folder.](UV_Maps/)
3. Open the UV in your drawing program (i.e. Krita, paint.net, etc.) and use it as a guide for your art. When you are ready to export it, make sure you set the UV to 100% transparent or delete it all together.
4. Export file as a .png and either DM it to me (@sky777.e4c) or create an issue on this GitHub with your file.
